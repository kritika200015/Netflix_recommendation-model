This notebook is a submission of one of the task assigned on this dataset on kaggle which is create a recommendation model for the movies and TV/Shows.

I have used TF-IDF technique to create this model with 2 different kernels just to see which one works better for me. After the results it was clear that TF-IDF with linear kernel using cosine similarities is better.

Thank you for reading!!
